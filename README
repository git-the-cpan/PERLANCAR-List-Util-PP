SYNOPSIS

     use PERLANCAR::List::Util::PP qw(max min maxstr minstr);
    
     my $max = max @list;
     my $min = min @list;

DESCRIPTION

    NOTE: EARLY RELEASE, NOT ALL FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED

    Most of the time you will not need this module. Use List::Util instead.
    This module is useful for testing/benchmarking, or perhaps in the rare
    case where you cannot use any XS module (even core ones) or in the rare
    case where you cannot use any module, in which case you can
    copy-and-paste the routines from this module (or, if you use
    Dist::Zilla, you can also use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock).

    List::Util::PP was also available as part of Scalar-List-Utils but was
    dropped (it was still included as part of perl 5.16). I plan to
    incorporate (at least some) code from the old code base [2].
