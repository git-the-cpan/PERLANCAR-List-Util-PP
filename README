SYNOPSIS

    Use as you would use List::Util:

     use PERLANCAR::List::Util::PP qw(max min maxstr minstr);
    
     my $max = max @list;
     my $min = min @list;

DESCRIPTION

    Most of the time you will not need this module. Use List::Util instead.
    This module is useful for testing/benchmarking, or perhaps in the rare
    case where you cannot use any XS module (even core ones) or in the rare
    case where you cannot use any module, in which case you can
    copy-and-paste the routines from this module (or, if you use
    Dist::Zilla, you can also use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertBlock).

    Most of the code is from the old List::Util::PP code [2], which was
    dropped from the Scalar-List-Utils distribution and was no longer part
    of core perl.
